Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is Celestia?
Celestia is a modular data availability network. It simplifies the process of launching blockchains, making blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly. Unlike traditional blockchains that handle multiple functions, Celestia specializes in specific roles, 
which leads to enhanced scalability, flexibility, and interoperability. This specialization enables developers to create blockchain applications for mass adoptionâ€‹.

## Where to get TIA?
Option 1: an exchange. A list can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celestia#markets). Or, using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services 
[here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Not all of these services list TIA.

## A list of Celestia wallets
The best way to store TIA, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. 
A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! 
A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You will probably need the [Keplr]((https://www.keplr.app/) extension . Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

## How to stake TIA?
Staking TIA is easy as 1,2,3. Let's go thorough 2 options:

1) You know what you're doing and how to delegate. Simply use [the Citizen Web3 validator address: cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) and delegate!

2) You're using an extension with or without a hardware wallet
