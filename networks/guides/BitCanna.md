## What is BitCanna?
BitCanna creates equal opportunities for the Cannabis and related industries by supporting them with a payment system, supply chain solution and review platform. [BCNA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcanna) is the main token of the BitCanna. It is used to help secure the network, transact, participate in governance and can be staked to receive rewards.

BitCanna is an interoperable blockchain protocol that facilitates the transfer of data between existing chains. It operates via a hub-and-spoke model that leverages the design elements of other chains to enable cross-chain interaction. The BitCanna framework features a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm developed by Tendermint to secure the protocol.

In simpler words, with BitCanna you can transfer any data, not just tokens. Think of a big complicated Excel table, not one table, but many. Think of macros. Remember when you had to connect one Excel table to another, and then everytime you made changes in one cell, the data would change accordingly in the other tables? Pretty much the same thing works here. But, using blockchain technology, a trustless setup and a consensus protocol that makes sure everything is secure and works as planned.

## Where to get BCNA?
Option 1: an exchange. A list can be found [here](https://www.bitcanna.io/#Exchanges). Or, using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Not all of these services list BCNA.

## BitCanna wallets
The best way to store BCNA, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You will probably need the [Keplr]((https://www.keplr.app/) extension, or the [Bitcanna wallet](https://wallet.bitcanna.io/validators/bcnavaloper1ngt4atd3qlgcwfv7fkjdjxhz7k0vl2rejrvzye). Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

## How to stake Bitcanna
Staking BCNA is easy as 1,2,3. Let's go through 2 options:

1) You know what you're doing and how to delegate. Simply use [the Citizen Web3 validator address: bcnavaloper1ngt4atd3qlgcwfv7fkjdjxhz7k0vl2rejrvzye](https://www.mintscan.io/bitcanna/validators/bcnavaloper1ngt4atd3qlgcwfv7fkjdjxhz7k0vl2rejrvzye) and delegate!

2) You're using an extension with or without a hardware wallet
