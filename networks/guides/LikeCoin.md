Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is LikeCoin?
LikeCoin is an application-specific blockchain on decentralized publishing built on Cosmos SDK. LikeCoin provides open source products ranging from infrastructure to publishing tools for creators on board to Web3. [LIKE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/likecoin) is the main token of the LikeCoin. It is used to help secure the network, transact, participate in governance and can be staked to receive rewards.

LikeCoin's International Standard Content Number, abbreviated as ISCN, is a metadata framework for digital content on the LikeCoin chain. ISCN is like a digital content ID; helps to identify a specific digital content, records the content metadata, the intellectual property rights, and the stakeholders of the creation. ISCN also represents the property right layer of LikeCoin NFT, it records the relationships between the content and creator.

LikeCoin utilizes Cosmos SDKâ€™s x/nft standard enables users to create NFT classes and mint NFTs under an ISCN metadata record.

## Where to get LIKE?
Option 1: an exchange. A list can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/likecoin#markets). Or, using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Not all of these services list LIKE.

## A list of LikeCoin wallets
The best way to store LIKE, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You will probably need the [Keplr]((https://www.keplr.app/) extension . Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

## How to stake LIKE?
Staking LIKE is easy as 1,2,3. Let's go thorough 2 options:

1) You know what you're doing and how to delegate. Simply use [the Citizen Web3 validator address: cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) and delegate!

2) You're using an extension with or without a hardware wallet
