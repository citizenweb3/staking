# Cyber / Bostrom 

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is Cyber / Bostrom?
Cyber is a distributed, self-sustainable computer for answers, managed and governed by its users. Its architecture resembles a superintelligent AI organism, in that it can learn upon the data it's fed by its users and provide them answers without blackbox intermediaries. What this means, is that in essence, Cyber is a general-knowledge layer for creating applications and tools that require provable indexing and ranking of any type of content. These can be decentralized search engines, such as [cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai) or decentralized social media, such as [Quitter](https://cyb.ai/sixthSense).

Cyber's goal is to create an open alternative to the closed semantics core of web2, to be used by AI, machine learning algorithms and users alike. By achieving a higher degree of decentralization to the web infrastructure, Cyber strives to create a universal, innovative search mechanism that can help avoid censorship and prove content verification (via the use of cryptography). By using blockchain and [cyberlinks](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-is-a-cyberlink) (a simple connection of 2 points, which can be information, data, block number, photo, video, transaction, Geo position, etc.) Cyber strives to provide more resistance to web3, than web2 has ever had.

At the heart of Cyber lay content addressing, a way to locate information on the web using the content, rather than referring to its location, thus avoiding censorship, and its energy model, which is a [Sybil resistant](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#technical-questions-in-plain-terms) spam protection mechanism that allows to eliminate transactional fees and achieve transaction scalability.

You may think of Cyber akin to a huge Wikipedia without censorship, which is at the moment waiting to be filled with knowledge from the current web, or even by a transition of data to the new, transparent web. A web in which you control your own dataset. A web that is free of censorship. A web where the internet works for you and not the other way around.

Cyber is basically a big decentralized [knowledge graph](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#technical-questions-in-plain-terms), to which users add and read information from. While validators (of Cyber) use their machines to rank and index the user provided information in a trustless manner. For now, Cyber works with a technology called [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), which is basically, a distributed P2P storage where users can safely store and exchange data, but Cyber can work with any similar technology such as DAT, GIT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Swarm, etc.

Cyber has no jurisdictions, CEO's and has its own [decentralized bank/VC fund](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation) charged with ETH and managed by the community. The whole protocol is parametrized. I.E. anything can be changed via voting, including the ranking mechanism, inflation parameters and so on.

To recap: Cyber is a communication layer between the new internet and the user. The twist is that this communication layer forms quite a complex layer in itself. A layer that contains blockchain, cryptography, economical incentives and is not managed by any central party, but rather, by a collective mind. Also, the layer allows for the creation of applications on top of it. That layer, opposed to 'OSI layers' is managed by a DAO and has is self-sustainable.

## Where to get BOOT?
Option 1: an exchange. A list can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cosmos#markets). Or, using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Not all of these services list BOOT.

## A list of Bostrom wallets
The best way to store BOOT, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You will probably need the [Keplr]((https://www.keplr.app/) extension . Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

## How to stake BOOT?
Staking BOOT is easy as 1,2,3. Let's go thorough 2 options:

1) You know what you're doing and how to delegate. Simply use [the Citizen Web3 validator address: bostromvaloper1f7nx65pmayfenpfwzwaamwas4ygmvalqj6dz5r](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/hero/bostromvaloper1f7nx65pmayfenpfwzwaamwas4ygmvalqj6dz5r) and delegate!

2) You're using an extension with or without a hardware wallet
