# Neutron

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is Neutron?
Neutron describes itself as the most secure CosmWasm platform in Cosmos. Neutron lets smart contracts query, transact and manage accounts in remote zones directly from Neutron. Neutron is able to work because of Interchain Accounts (ICA) which let Cosmos blockchains control accounts (aka “wallets”) on remote zones via IBC, instead of local private keys, and write transactions that can be executed on the remote chain.

Neutron aims to be both a “host” and a “controller” and will launch with a custom implementation that makes Interchain Accounts available to smart contracts. It means smart contracts on Neutron will be able to interact with modules and zones from other ICA-enabled Cosmos chains and vice versa.

## Where to get NTRN?
Option 1: an exchange. A list can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cosmos#markets). Or, using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Not all of these services list NTRN.

## A list of Neutron wallets
The best way to store NTRN, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You will probably need the [Keplr]((https://www.keplr.app/) extension . Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

## How to stake NTRN?
Staking NTRN is easy as 1,2,3. Let's go thorough 2 options:

1) You know what you're doing and how to delegate. Simply use [the Citizen Web3 validator address: neutronvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc2qrx6v](https://www.mintscan.io/neutron/ics-validators/neutronvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc2qrx6v) and delegate!

2) You're using an extension with or without a hardware wallet
