# EVMOS

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is EVMOS?
Evmos is bringing the world of Ethereum-based applications and assets to the interoperable networks of the Cosmos ecosystem, all while aligning developer and user incentives. 

To learn more, we suggest to read [these articles]([https://citizen-cosmos.github.io/blog/#evmos-rule-em-all](https://citizenweb3.github.io/manuscripts/tags/evmos/)) and to listen to this [podcast](https://www.citizencosmos.space/evmos).

## Where to get EVMOS?
Option 1: an exchange. A list can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/evmos#markets). Or, using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Not all of these services list ATOM.

## A list of EVMOS wallets
The best way to store ATOM, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You will probably need the [Keplr]((https://www.keplr.app/) extension . Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

## How to stake EVMOS?
Staking EVMOS is easy as 1,2,3. Let's go thorough 2 options:

1) You know what you're doing and how to delegate. Simply use [the Citizen Web3 validator address: evmosvaloper1mtwvpdd57gpkyejd566s24afr9zm5ryq8gwpvj](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/validators/evmosvaloper1mtwvpdd57gpkyejd566s24afr9zm5ryq8gwpvj) and delegate!

2) You're using an extension with or without a hardware wallet
