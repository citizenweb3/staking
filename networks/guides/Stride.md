# Stride

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is Stride?
Stride is a blockchain that provides liquidity for staked tokens. Using Stride, you can earn both staking and DeFi yields across the Cosmos IBC ecosystem. [STRD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stride) is the main token of the Stride. It is used to participate in governance and can be staked to receive rewards. Stride secured by Cosmos hub validator set(ICS). 

Users can liquid stake their tokens on any Cosmos chain using Stride and further use them in DeFi.

## Where to get STRD?
Option 1: an exchange. A list can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cosmos#markets). Or, using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Not all of these services list STRD.

## A list of STRD wallets
The best way to store ATOM, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You will probably need the [Keplr]((https://www.keplr.app/) extension . Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

## How to stake STRD?
Staking STRD is easy as 1,2,3. Let's go thorough 2 options:

1) You know what you're doing and how to delegate. Simply use [the Citizen Web3 validator address: cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) and delegate!

2) You're using an extension with or without a hardware wallet
