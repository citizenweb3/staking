# OmniFlix

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is OmniFlix?
OmniFlix is a p2p network for creators, studios & brands with the infrastructure to mint, manage and monetize media assets and communities. [FLIX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/omniflix-network) is the main token of the OmniFlix. It is used to help secure the network, transact, participate in governance and can be staked to receive rewards.

OmniFlix is an interoperable blockchain protocol that facilitates the transfer of data between existing chains. It operates via a hub-and-spoke model that leverages the design elements of other chains to enable cross-chain interaction. The OmniFlix framework features a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm developed by Tendermint to secure the protocol.

In simpler words, with OmniFlix you can transfer any data, not just tokens. Think of a big complicated Excel table, not one table, but many. Think of macros. Remember when you had to connect one Excel table to another, and then everytime you made changes in one cell, the data would change accordingly in the other tables? Pretty much the same thing works here. But, using blockchain technology, a trustless setup and a consensus protocol that makes sure everything is secure and works as planned.

## How to obtain FLIX tokens?
You can purchase them on an exchange. The list of exchanges can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/omniflix-network#markets). Or, you can purchase them using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Note, that not all of these services list FLIX.

For beginners, we advise to either use [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=USDC&to=FLIX) or something like [Simpleswap](https://simpleswap.io/). Please be cautious when using any service listed above and do your own due diligence first. Always and always(!) test the service first using small sums, and if it's ok, then, do your other transaction/s.

## A list of OmniFlix wallets
The best way to store FLIX, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You can always find a community maintained list of FLIX wallets [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/delegators-cosmos-tendermint-guides-wallets-explorers-tools/2168). If you don't have a Ledger, the easiest wallet to use is the [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) extension on your desktop, or [Cosmostation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wannabit.io.cosmostaion) on your mobile device (can also be used for desktop). Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

If you do have a Ledger, then [Cosmostation](https://www.cosmostation.io/) is your best pick, just [connect your device](https://wallet.cosmostation.io/) and start using it.
