# EVMOS

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is EVMOS?
Evmos is bringing the world of Ethereum-based applications and assets to the interoperable networks of the Cosmos ecosystem, all while aligning developer 
and user incentives. 

To learn more, we suggest to read [these articles]([https://citizen-cosmos.github.io/blog/#evmos-rule-em-all](https://citizenweb3.github.io/manuscripts/tags/evmos/)) and to listen to this 
[podcast](https://www.citizencosmos.space/evmos).

## How to obtain EVMOS tokens?
You can purchase them on an exchange. The list of exchanges can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/evmos#markets). Or, you can purchase 
them using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services 
[here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Note, that not all of these services list EVMOS.

Please be cautious when using any service listed above and do your own due diligence first. Always and always(!) test the service first using small sums, 
and if it's ok, then, do your other transaction/s.

## A list of EVMOS wallets
The best way to store EVMOS, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). 
We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD 
and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase 
hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device 
manufacturers.

Do use [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/)!
