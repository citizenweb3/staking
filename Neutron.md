# Neutron

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is Neutron?
Neutron describes itself as the most secure CosmWasm platform in Cosmos. Neutron lets smart contracts query, transact and manage accounts in remote zones directly from Neutron

Neutron is able to work because of Interchain Accounts (ICA) which let Cosmos blockchains control accounts (aka “wallets”) on remote zones via IBC, instead of local private keys, and write transactions that can be executed on the remote chain.

Neutron will be both a “host” and a “controller” and will launch with a custom implementation that makes Interchain Accounts available to smart contracts.

It means smart contracts on Neutron will be able to interact with modules and zones from other ICA-enabled Cosmos chains and vice versa.

## How to obtain NTRN  tokens?
Soon you will be able to purchase them on a DEX. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Note, that not all of these services list NTRN.

The most liquid DEX at the moment is [Astroport](https://app.astroport.fi/)(running natively on the chain). You can read the FAQ on [how to use Astroport](https://blog.astroport.fi/post/astroport-on-neutron-faqs-bridging-geoblocks-and-more).

You can also try to use [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/) or something like [Simpleswap](https://simpleswap.io/). Please be cautious when using any service listed above and do your own due diligence first. Always and always(!) test the service first using small sums, and if it's ok, then, do your other transaction/s.

## A list of Neutron wallets
The best way to store NTRN , or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You can always find a community maintained list of NTRN wallets [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/delegators-cosmos-tendermint-guides-wallets-explorers-tools/2168). If you don't have a Ledger, the easiest wallet to use is the [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) extension on your desktop, or [Cosmostation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wannabit.io.cosmostaion) on your mobile device (can also be used for desktop). Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

If you do have a Ledger, then [Cosmostation](https://www.cosmostation.io/) is your best pick, just [connect your device](https://wallet.cosmostation.io/) and start using it.
