## Citizen Web3 validator: Staking
Citizen Web3 is a self-hosted, independent off the grid, baremetal validator. We use a mixture of cloud and self-hosted infrastructure, which works on a mixture of broadband and Starlink internet connections, and partially runs off solar energy. We strongly believe in decentralized infrastructure, independent of the grid, and that's our end goal.

We use Multi-party computation software [(Horcrux)](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux) on all our nodes, to further secure funds, and protect stakers from double signing. We use [Re-Stake](https://restake.app/) on all of our mainnet nodes, set to restake twice per day, so users can compound their staking rewards more efficiently.

Token holders of networks we validate, can stake with us to help secure these networks and to support our activities. Their incentive for doing so, is earning staking rewards, and other, [planned](https://github.com/citizenweb3/super-pancake/issues), incentives in the future. We are devoted to our [mission](https://github.com/citizenweb3#tldr), we think out of the box, and are proud to be a little crazy. We value security, decentralization, privacy and lack of enforcement.
