If you wish to suggest a network that CC should validate, please feel welcome to [open an issue](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Staking/issues) or contact us in any other way. However, it should be noted that we choose the networks we participate in, solely to meet our project aims and values. If we don't understand what value we bring to an ecosystem, then what's the point?
