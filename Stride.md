# Stride

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is Stride?
Stride is a blockchain that provides liquidity for staked tokens. Using Stride, you can earn both staking and DeFi yields across the Cosmos IBC ecosystem. [STRD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stride) is the main token of the Stride. It is used to participate in governance and can be staked to receive rewards. Stride secured by Cosmos hub validator set(ICS).

Users can liquid stake their tokens on any Cosmos chain using Stride and further use them in DeFi. Currently, Stride supports liquid staking for:

- stATOM(CosmosHub)
- stOSMO(Osmosis)
- stJUNO(Juno)
- stSTARS(Stargaze)
- stEVMOS(EVMOS)
- stLUNA(Terra 2)
- stINJ(Injective)
- stUMEE(Umee)

## How to obtain STRD tokens?
You can purchase them on an exchange. The list of exchanges can be found [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stride/#Markets). Or, you can purchase them using a DEX or a so-called 'swap service'. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Note, that not all of these services list STRD.

For beginners, we advise to either use [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=ATOM&to=STRD) or something like [Kujira Fin](https://fin.kujira.network/trade/kujira1cn922pcqrt4g2dr4va9vxk8h3w3jfxnxjqq2qp6zktjsehdzde6sz66um0?q=all). Please be cautious when using any service listed above and do your own due diligence first. Always and always(!) test the service first using small sums, and if it's ok, then, do your other transaction/s.

## A list of STRD wallets
The best way to store STRD, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those. We still, however, strongly encourage this. A device like this costs between 50-200 USD and if your crypto holdings exceed this sum, it makes sense to secure your holdings via this method offering an extra level of security. Please, purchase hardware devices only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device manufacturers.

You can always find a community maintained list of STRD wallets [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/delegators-cosmos-tendermint-guides-wallets-explorers-tools/2168). If you don't have a Ledger, the easiest wallet to use is the [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/download) extension on your desktop, or [Cosmostation](https://cosmostation.io/products/cosmostation_mobile) on your mobile device (can also be used for desktop). Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

If you do have a Ledger, then [Cosmostation](https://www.cosmostation.io/) is your best pick, just [connect your device](https://wallet.cosmostation.io/) and start using it.
