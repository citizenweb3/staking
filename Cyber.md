# Cyber / Bostrom 

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is Cyber?
Cyber is a distributed, self-sustainable computer for answers, managed and governed by its users. Its architecture resembles a superintelligent AI organism, in that it can learn upon the data it's fed by its users and provide them answers without blackbox intermediaries. What this means, is that in essence, Cyber is a general-knowledge layer for creating applications and tools that require provable indexing and ranking of any type of content. These can be decentralized search engines, such as [cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai) or decentralized social media, such as [Quitter](https://cyb.ai/sixthSense).

Cyber's goal is to create an open alternative to the closed semantics core of web2, to be used by AI, machine learning algorithms and users alike. By achieving a higher degree of decentralization to the web infrastructure, Cyber strives to create a universal, innovative search mechanism that can help avoid censorship and prove content verification (via the use of cryptography). By using blockchain and [cyberlinks](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/ELI-5%20FAQ.md#what-is-a-cyberlink) (a simple connection of 2 points, which can be information, data, block number, photo, video, transaction, Geo position, etc.) Cyber strives to provide more resistance to web3, than web2 has ever had.

At the heart of Cyber lay content addressing, a way to locate information on the web using the content, rather than referring to its location, thus avoiding censorship, and its energy model, which is a [Sybil resistant](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#technical-questions-in-plain-terms) spam protection mechanism that allows to eliminate transactional fees and achieve transaction scalability.

You may think of Cyber akin to a huge Wikipedia without censorship, which is at the moment waiting to be filled with knowledge from the current web, or even by a transition of data to the new, transparent web. A web in which you control your own dataset. A web that is free of censorship. A web where the internet works for you and not the other way around.

Cyber is basically a big decentralized [knowledge graph](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#technical-questions-in-plain-terms), to which users add and read information from. While validators (of Cyber) use their machines to rank and index the user provided information in a trustless manner. For now, Cyber works with a technology called [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), which is basically, a distributed P2P storage where users can safely store and exchange data, but Cyber can work with any similar technology such as DAT, GIT, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Swarm, etc.

Cyber has no jurisdictions, CEO's and has its own [decentralized bank/VC fund](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber-foundation) charged with ETH and managed by the community. The whole protocol is parametrized. I.E. anything can be changed via voting, including the ranking mechanism, inflation parameters and so on.

To recap: Cyber is a communication layer between the new internet and the user. The twist is that this communication layer forms quite a complex layer in itself. A layer that contains blockchain, cryptography, economical incentives and is not managed by any central party, but rather, by a collective mind. Also, the layer allows for the creation of applications on top of it. That layer, opposed to 'OSI layers' is managed by a DAO and has is self-sustainable.

P.S. Bostrom is just the bootloader network. We propose you [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx95oqTW-6M) to learn more.

## How to obtain BOOT/CYB tokens?
BOOT are Cyber's bootloader tokens for the Bostrom network. CYB is the mainet token. These tokens are used to build the semantics core, to transact, to secure the network, to compute the rank, to stake and to receive rewards.

You can obtain BOOT tokens by trying to check if you were eligible to receive [a gift](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/53e1c28b-9f10-497c-9b5b-9f2a4749450b). Cyber airdropped some of its tokens to ETH & ATOM hodlers. 

Other ways to get BOOT were to participate in previous test networks and to earn the tokens via community pool, developing tools, etc

## A list of Cyber wallets
There are several wallets that can be used to store, manage, stake and transfer EUL tokens and can help you to create a wallet to start using Cyber. The [Keplr extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) is by far the easiest and the most intuitive to use. 

Cyber's native wallet is on their app: [cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai). It requires you to have a [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) device and when you 'pocket' it, you can get an address.

And, of course, you can use the [CLI](https://cybercongress.ai/docs/go-cyber/ultimate-commands-guide/) to create a wallet.

Please note, that Cyber is far from the mass adoption stage at the moment and most wallets are developer friendly. We suggest to use Keplr at this stage.

## A step-by-step staking guide
There are 2 ways to stake BOOT:

1) Using [Keplr](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Staking/blob/main/Cyber.md#keplr) or a Ledger device connected to [cyb.ai](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Staking/blob/main/Cyber.md#cyberpage)

2) You know what you're doing, so all you need is Citizen's Cosmos [validator address: bostromvaloper1f7nx65pmayfenpfwzwaamwas4ygmvalqj6dz5r](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/hero/bostromvaloper1f7nx65pmayfenpfwzwaamwas4ygmvalqj6dz5r)

### Keplr
Download and open [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap) (please find an extended guide to using Keplr [here](https://medium.com/@catdotfish/how-to-use-keplr-wallet-40afc80907f6)), make sure you have some BOOT on your balance, and:

1) Click the 'stake' button:

[![1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/g0HyWKWB/1.png)](https://postimg.cc/nsM9KBMv)

2) This will open a new browser window, in which you will see the list of the current, active validators. 
Make sure that in the 'chain' menu on the left, 'Bostrom' is selected. Find Citizen Cosmos and click 'manage':

3) A pop-up window will appear: make sure it says Citizen Cosmos and click 'delegate':

[![3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/bNSQJPPn/3.png)](https://postimg.cc/SJqXTwJQ)

4) Input the desired amount you wish to delegate, and click 'delegate':

5) Set the fee and click 'approve':

### cyber.page
If you have a Ledger device, you can connect to [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/pocket) and use Cyber's native app and staking module.

1) Assuming your Ledger is already pocketed (if not, follow this [guide](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/blob/master/ecosystem/Cyber%20Homestead%20doc.md#creating-a-cyber-wallet)), i.e. connected to the app, simply go to the [heroes page](https://cyber.page/heroes) and look for Citizen Cosmos:

2) Click on Citizen Cosmos, this will open a new page:

3) Click the 'stake' button at the bottom (make sure your Ledger is connected, unlocked and the Cosmos app is open). In the box that appeared at the bottom, enter the desired amount of GEUL you wish to delegate (1 GEUL = 1,000,000,000 EUL):

4) Click `generate tx` and confirm it on youe Ledger device:

Congratulations! You are now staking with Citizen Cosmos and recieving rewards. Don't forget to manage your reward and to re-delegate the accumulated reward back to Citizen Cosmos to earn more.
