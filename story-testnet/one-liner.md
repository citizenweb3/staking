```

## Features

The Story Node Setup Script offers a variety of features that help you set up and manage your Story node efficiently. Below is a breakdown of what each menu item can do:

### 1. Install Node (Full Setup)
- Checks your system's requirements (CPU, RAM, and disk space) to ensure compatibility.
- Installs necessary dependencies like Go and other libraries.
- Downloads and installs Story and Geth binaries.
- Initializes the node on the Iliad network.
- Configures the node with default settings, seeds, and peers.
- Sets up systemd services to run Story and Geth as background services.

### 2. Install Snapshot for Faster Sync
- Provides options to install a "Pruned" or "Archive" snapshot to speed up the initial synchronization of your node.

- Restarts the services to resume node operation.

### 3. Update Node
- Downloads and installs the latest Story and Geth binaries.
- Restarts the node services to apply the updates.

### 4. Create Validator
- Helps you set up a new validator by initializing the node with a unique moniker.
